Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in [Health Policy](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/programs/health-policy-phd) at the [University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu), with a specialization in Population Health and Data Science.

I use causal inference methods from epidemiology and econometrics to better understand what types of interventions and policies can improve reproductive and perinatal health in low-income and under-resourced communities around the world. My primary research interest is on the first 1,000 days of life, from pregnancy through age two—a critical stage of the life course where poor nutrition can lead to large, irreversible health and economic consequences later in adulthood and across future generations. My second area of research focuses on people who recently initiated HIV care, a period characterized by high mortality and attrition from care.

Prior to graduate school, I worked at the Office of Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness at the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en), assisting with impact evaluations of maternal and child health programs implemented in low-income and predominately indigenous communities in Latin America. 

I hold a B.S. in [Biostatistics](https://www.slu.edu/public-health-social-justice/programs-and-certificates/health-analytics/biostatistics.php) and [Public Health](https://www.slu.edu/public-health-social-justice/programs-and-certificates/public-health/public-health.php), with minors in Engineering Mathematics and Urban Poverty Studies, from [Saint Louis University College for Public Health and Social Justice](https://www.slu.edu/public-health-social-justice/index.php).
