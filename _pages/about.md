Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in [Health Policy]('https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/programs/health-policy-phd'), at the [University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health]('https://publichealth.berkeley.edu'), with a specialization in Population Health and Data Science.

My research broadly focuses on improving the health and health care of pregnant people, infants, and people living with HIV. I use interdisciplinary methods from epidemiology and health economics to understand how to better design, implement, evaluate, and scale-up community-based interventions to improve reproductive and perinatal health in low-income settings. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked at the Office of Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness at the [Inter-American Development Bank]('https://www.iadb.org/en/who-we-are/about-idb'), assisting with impact evaluations of maternal and child health programs implemented in low-income and predominately indigenous communities in Latin America. 

I hold a B.S. in [Biostatistics]('https://www.slu.edu/public-health-social-justice/programs-and-certificates/health-analytics/biostatistics.php') and [Public Health]('https://www.slu.edu/public-health-social-justice/programs-and-certificates/public-health/public-health.php'), with minors in Engineering Mathematics and Urban Poverty Studies, from [Saint Louis University College for Public Health and Social Justice]('https://www.slu.edu/public-health-social-justice/index.php').
