Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in [Health Policy]('https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/programs/health-policy-phd'), at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, with a specialization in Population Health and Data Science.

My research broadly focuses on improving the health and health care of pregnant people, infants, and people living with HIV. I use interdisiplinary methods from epidemiology and health economics to understand how to better design, implement, evaluate, and scale-up community-based interventions to improve reproductive and perinatal health in low-income settings. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked at the [Inter-American Development Bank]('https://www.iadb.org/en/who-we-are/about-idb') in the Office of Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness, assisting with impact evaluations of maternal and child health programs implemented in low-income and predominately indigenous communities in Latin America. 

I hold a BS in Biostatistics and Public Health, with minors in Engineering Mathematics and Urban Poverty Studies, from Saint Louis University College for Public Health and Social Justice.
