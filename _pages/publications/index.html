Strategies to improve recommended infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, especially during the first two years of life, are considered among the most effective. In this paper, we evaluate the long-run impacts of an innovative education strategy based on interactive play and performing arts implemented in El Alto, Bolivia on caregivers’ IYCF knowledge and practices. Two thousand and fifteen households were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Two rounds of data were collected approximately 30 and 42 months after baseline. We estimate short-term (30 month) and longer-term (42 month) intent-to-treat effects using multivariate linear regression analysis, with and without controlling for covariates. The program significantly increased caregiver IYCF knowledge by 0.13 SDs in the short run, and this effect grew over time. The program also improved adherence to recommended IYCF practices by 0.23 standard deviations (SDs) in the short term, but the effect on practices dissipated over time, and no longer-term impacts were detected. Caregivers with above median baseline knowledge, number of children, and age appear to have benefited most from the program. Our findings suggest that entertainment-education interventions are a promising model for improving and maintaining IYCF knowledge. However, their ability to sustain more permanent changes in IYCF practices is less certain. Further evidence is needed to identify other avenues for producing long-term, sustainable behavior change, especially among indigenous populations in Latin America, where literature on education and behavior-change interventions related to IYCF practices is limited.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="TZ_mental_health_incentives" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">The impact of financial incentives on mental health among Aaults in HIV care in Lake Zone, Tanzania: A two-arm randomized controlled trial</div> <div class="author"> Pooja Chitle, Lila A Sheira, Emmanuel Katabaro, <em>Solis Winters</em>, Prosper F Njau, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Though economic interventions can improve care engagement and mental health in the general population, this remains understudied among PLHIV. This study assessed whether financial incentives improve mental health among adult antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiates in Lake Zone, Tanzania. From 2021-2023, 32 clinics were randomized to offer patients monthly financial incentives (22,500 TSH/$10 USD) for ≤6 months (conditional on visit attendance) or standard-of-care (SoC) services. We assessed changes in depression (PHQ-2 scores) and anxiety (GAD-2 scores) symptoms at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Difference-in-differences effects were used to estimate changes over time by arm using inverse probability of censoring sample weights (IPCW). Participants (n = 1990) were 57.3% female; median age was 35.0. Baseline prevalences of depression and anxiety symptoms were 66.2% and 60.4%, respectively, and endline prevalences were 7.8% and 7.6%, respectively, with no differences by arm. Using IPCW, the differences in the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms between arms were 2.5 percentage points (95% CI: −3.0, 8.0) and 2.3 percentage points (95% CI: −3.2, 7.9) respectively after 6 months, and 5.5 percentage points (95% CI: −0.20, 10.8) and 3.8 percentage points (95% CI: −1.5, 9.2) respectively after 12 months. Both study arms experienced substantial reductions in poor mental health, primarily within the first 6 months of care. Financial incentives provided in this study did not significantly augment these downward trends but may improve engagement in care, indirectly improving mental health.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="TZ_mental_health" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Increased prevalence of depression and anxiety among adults initiating antiretroviral therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Shinyanga region, Tanzania</div> <div class="author"> <em>Solis Winters</em>, Amon Sabasaba, Carolyn A Fahey, Laura Packel, Emmanuel Katabaro, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

This study assessed whether there were temporal changes in the mental health status of people living with HIV presenting for care in Shinyanga region, Tanzania. Specifically, we compared the prevalence of depression and anxiety before and during COVID-19, with the goal of describing the changing needs, if any, to person-centered HIV services. We analyzed baseline data from two randomized controlled trials of adults initiating ART in Shinyanga region, Tanzania between April-December 2018 (pre-COVID-19 period, n = 530) and May 2021-March 2022 (COVID-19 period, n = 542), respectively. We compared three mental health indicators that were similarly measured in both surveys: loss of interest in things, hopelessness about the future, and uncontrolled worrying. We also examined depression and anxiety which were measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 in the pre-COVID-19 period and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 in the COVID-19 period, respectively, and classified as binary indicators per each scale’s threshold. We estimated prevalence differences (PD) in adverse mental health status before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for underlying differences in the two study populations. We found significant temporal increases in the prevalence of feeling ‘a lot’ and ‘extreme’ loss of interest in things [‘a lot’ PD: 38, CI 34,41; ‘extreme’ PD: 9, CI 8,12)], hopelessness about the future [‘ a lot’ PD: 46, CI 43,49; ‘extreme’ PD: 4, CI 3,6], and uncontrolled worrying [‘ a lot’ PD: 34, CI 31,37; ‘extreme’ PD: 2, CI 0,4] during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found substantially higher prevalence of depression [PD: 38, CI 34,42] and anxiety [PD: 41, CI 37,45]. After applying a quasi-experimental weighting approach, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among those starting ART during COVID-19 was much higher than before the pandemic. Although depression and anxiety were measured using different, validated scales, the concurrent increases in similarly measured mental health indicators lends confidence to these findings and warrants further research to assess the possible influence of COVID-19 on mental health among adults living with HIV.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="empowerment" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">How does women’s empowerment relate to antenatal care attendance?

A much greater proportion of women attend at least one antenatal care visit, suggesting that a key challenge is ensuring that women initiate antenatal care early in pregnancy and continue to attend after their first visit. One critical barrier to antenatal care attendance may be that women do not have sufficient power in their relationships, households, or communities to attend antenatal care when they want to. The main goals of this paper were to 1) understand the potential effects of intervening on direct measures of women’s empowerment—including household decision making, freedom of movement, and control over assets—on antenatal care attendance in a rural population of women in Bangladesh, and 2) examine whether differential associations exist across strata of socioeconomic status. We analyzed data on 1609 mothers with children under 24 months old in rural Bangladesh and employed targeted maximum likelihood estimation with ensemble machine learning to estimate population average treatment effects. Greater women’s empowerment was associated with an increased number of antenatal care visits. Specifically, among women who attended at least one antenatal care visit, having high empowerment was associated with a greater probability of ≥ 4 antenatal care visits, both in comparison to low empowerment (15.2 pp, 95% CI: 6.0, 24.4) and medium empowerment (9.1 pp, 95% CI: 2.5, 15.7). The subscales of women’s empowerment driving the associations were women’s decision-making power and control over assets. We found that greater women’s empowerment is associated with more antenatal care visits regardless of socioeconomic status. Empowerment-based interventions, particularly those targeting women’s involvement in household decisions and/or facilitating greater control over assets, may be a valuable strategy for increasing antenatal care attendance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="Bolivia_refrigeration" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Refrigeration and child growth: What is the connection?</div> <div class="author"> Sebastian Martinez, Juan M Murguia, Brisa Rejas, and <em>Solis Winters</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition</em>, Apr 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Child stunting in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) decreased from 22.9% in 1990 to 9.6% in 2017. While stunting rates in the region were falling, access to electricity and refrigeration were on the rise. Despite a large body of evidence surrounding the effects of refrigeration on food consumption, and separately of the importance of food consumption for child health and nutrition, surprisingly few studies explore the potential effects of refrigeration on child nutrition. We studied the relationship between refrigeration and child nutrition outcomes using rich panel data for 1298 low-income households with children younger than 12 months at baseline in El Alto, Bolivia. We estimated the effects of refrigerator ownership on diet and nutrition outcomes using a difference-in-difference approach. Owning a refrigerator was associated with increased food expenditures and improved child nutrition. We found evidence that households that acquired a refrigerator were more likely to buy food that requires refrigeration, and children in households that acquired refrigerators were 0.17 standard deviations taller for their age after 2 years. We also found that refrigeration was associated with a 0.26 standard deviation decline in BMI-for-age, an effect driven by increased height rather than lower weight. These results suggest that refrigeration may play a role in explaining reductions in undernutrition observed in low- and middle-income countries in recent decades.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="distance_panama" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Distance as a barrier to obstetric care among indigenous women in Panama: A cross-sectional study</div> <div class="author"> Paloma Acevedo, Sebastian Martinez, Leanardo Pinzon, Emmanuelle Sanchez-Monin, and <em>Solis Winters</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>BMJ Open</em>, Mar 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We assess the relationship between distance to a woman’s assigned health clinic and obstetric care utilisation. We employ a cross-sectional study design using baseline data from the evaluation of a conditional cash transfer programme to promote greater utilisation of maternal and infant health services. Data were collected between December 2016 and January 2017. The study is conducted in Ngäbe Buglé, the largest of Panama’s three indigenous territories, where maternal mortality is three times the national average. We analyse a representative sample of 1336 indigenous women with a birth in the 12 months prior to the survey. Primary outcomes include obstetric care utilisation measures for prenatal, childbirth and postpartum events. Secondary outcomes include reasons for not receiving prenatal care, alarming symptoms, child weight at birth and stillbirths or miscarriages. Compared with women in closest geographic proximity to a health centre (top quintile, Q1), women who lived farthest from a health centre (bottom quintile, Q5) had significantly lower obstetric care utilisation outcomes for critical prenatal, childbirth and postpartum events. Mothers in Q5 were 36 percentage points less likely to have had at least one prenatal care appointment in a hospital, health centre or clinic compared with mothers in Q1 (p&lt;0.01), and 52 percentage points less likely to attend an institutional first appointment (p&lt;0.01). The gap in institutional delivery and postnatal care between mothers in Q1 and Q5 was about 35 percentage points (p&lt;0.01). All utilisation outcomes were negatively correlated with distance, and differences in obstetric care utilisation persisted even when controlling for household wealth, maternal age and maternal education. Distance is an important barrier to obstetric care utilisation, with women in more distant locations suffering significantly lower use of prenatal, childbirth and postpartum care compared with women in closer vicinity to a health establishment. Expanding the supply of healthcare and implementing demand side incentives to promote the use of health services in remote communitiesare relevant policies to reduce disparities in obstetric careutilisation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="SPOON_protocol" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Effect of an innovative behavioural change strategy and small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements on stunting and obesity in children in Baja Verapaz, Guatemala: Protocol for a randomised control trial</div> <div class="author"> Carolina González Acero, Sebastian Martinez, Ana Pérez-Expósito, and <em>Solis Winters</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>BMJ Open</em>, Jul 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In Latin America, a rapid increase in obesity alongside persistent malnutrition has resulted in a double burden of disease that affects the most vulnerable segments of the population. Infant and young child feeding practices are important factors that affect both sides of the growth curve. Interventions such as behavioural change strategies and home fortification using products like small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) have the potential to reduce the presence of both these conditions, especially if they are implemented during the first 1000 days of life. This paper details the protocol for SPOON: Sustained Programme for Improving Nutrition, an innovative strategy to prevent stunting and reduce risk for obesity in children under 24 months old in high-poverty areas in Baja Verapaz, Guatemala. SPOON: Sustained Programme for Improving Nutrition Guatemala is a three-arm randomised control trial: treatment group 1 will receive the programme behavioural change strategy and SQ-LNS, treatment group 2 will receive the programme behavioural change strategy and micronutrient powders; the control group will receive the standard of care provided by the Ministry of Health, which includes micronutrient powders. A modified formula of SQ-LNS has been especially developed for this trial. A total of 76 communities are included in the study and 1628 households with a pregnant woman in the third trimester or a child under 4.5 months were recruited at baseline. Baseline data were collected between September and November 2018. Follow-up data will be collected 2 years after the start of the intervention. The primary outcomes of interest are related to mothers’ infant feeding knowledge and practice, and indicators of children’s nutritional status and growth including height, weight, weight gain rate and prevalence of stunting, overweight, obesity and anaemia. After follow-up data have been collected, differences of simple means and regression models including covariates such as child’s age and sex, characteristics of the primary caregiver and household socioeconomic indicators will be estimated. Heterogeneous effects will also be estimated within subgroups of age at exposure, sex, caregiver characteristics and household socioeconomic status. This study was approved by the National Health Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health of Guatemala (resolution 10–2018). Informed consent was obtained from all mothers and caregivers prior to enrolment in the programme. Results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed medical or public health journal, and disseminated internally at the Inter-American Development Bank, with the Government and Stakeholders in Guatemala and through international conferences and seminars.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </body> </html>
