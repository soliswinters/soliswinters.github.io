            <p>"This course provides an overview of the major nutritional issues faced by women of childbearing age, infants, children, and adolescents in the United States and around the world, with selected topics explored in greater depth. Nutritional problems are multi-factorial and occur at multiple levels and we will study them from a variety of viewpoints (biological, pyschological, socio-cultural, economic, political, and behavioral) as well as from individual and population perspectives. Participants in the course will become acquainted with nutritional research, policies, and interventions designed to enhance reproduction, growth, and development. This course will also explore health disparities in maternal and child nutrition in both a domestic and international context."</p>

            <p>"We will focus on low- and middle-income countries because they experience the greatest burden of malnutrition, and because they face a unique context of limited financial and government resources. In this course, we will discuss the effects of nutrition throughout the lifecycle in pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and adulthood. We will focus on nutrition broadly including issues of undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and obesity. We will also analyze and evaluate actions taken to ameliorate the major nutritional problems facing vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries."</p>
